    <h1>who am I?</h1>

    <p>Well... that is a question I ask myself a lot. I guess I'm just a guy with a loop station and many ideas. Also many unclear emotions I'm trying to untangle.</p>
	
	<p> Honestly, I'm not good at describing myself, but I'm lucky enough to have a friend, Jonina Rebekka, who wrote 
	<a href="jonina_paper_plumbus.pdf" target="_blank"> a paper about me</a> (yeah, I can never thank her enough for that!). 
	Also, take a look at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joninarebekka/" target="_blank"> her instagram profile</a>. She is quite an interesting person and artist!
